        <span class='ocanada'></span> 。Welcome! 
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! I am an MScSLP/PhD student at the University of Alberta. Here I will write about my experiences, academic activities, thoughts in daily life, and share clinical and academic resources. English is my second language and I write a lot in Chinese. I hope I'll post blogs in both English and Chinese here.
      </p>

      </h1>
      <p>
        My name is 林悠然 Lin Youran <a href="linyouran.mp3" target='_blank'>[lin˦˥ jo͡ʊ˥ ɻan˦˥]</a>, and I'd happily go by "<a href="youran.mp3" target='_blank'>Youran</a>" as in "You ran a 100-meter" if that's easier to pronounce! I am from Harbin, China, and spent seven years in Beijing studying Linguistics. I came to Edmonton, Canada in 2018 to study Speech-Language Pathology. Fun fact: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twin_towns_and_sister_cities_in_Canada' target='_blank'>Harbin and Edmonton are twin cities</a>!

        "When feeling uncertain about future directions, take the more challenging roads." This is what has led me to this challenging but beautiful journey. It took me all the way from Chinese Language and Literature to Linguistics, to Phonetics, to Child Phonology Development, and to SLP. It took me from the other side of the earth to Canada. Yet the journey still goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am in a combined program of MScSLP and PhD, which means I'm taking the professional training in SLP and doing a doctoral research project at the same time. It is an intense program but I'm really enjoying it. I'm especially interested in working with clients with speech disorders, including speech sound, voice, resonance, fluency, and motor speech disorders. My research interests include speech development in bilingual children and second language learners, the Chinese speech and language in multilingual and multicultural contexts, and speech-language pathology in non-English communities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working with my supervisors, <a href='https://www.ualberta.ca/rehabilitation/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/karen-pollock#' target='_blank'>Dr. Karen Pollock</a> and <a href='http://people.uleth.ca/~fangfang.li/' target='_blank'>Dr. Fangfang Li</a>, on a project about the speech development in children who are enrolled in the public Mandarin-English bilingual education programs. I hope this will help the children from Chinese families maintain their heritage language, and help the children who are learning Mandarin as a second language to use it to communicate more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the side of my coursework and research, I provide consultation for international students who are preparing for their applications and who want to reduce accents to improve their communication. I also enjoy cooking and singing a lot. Also enjoy talking about research with my partner <a href="http://meep.cubing.net/portfolio" target="_blank">Kris</a> who studies Reinforcement Learning in the Department of Computing Sciences. They were the talented creator of this website.
