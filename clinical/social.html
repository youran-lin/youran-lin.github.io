      I developed several social lessons for grade 1 and 2 students with diverse language and speech needs, in conjunction with my clinical educator. Students can learn social communication skills through multimedia education and discussion and practice these skills through role-plays and games. The curriculum was adapted from <a href="https://www.socialthinking.com/Products/think-social-curriculum-for-school-age-students" target="_blank">Think Social! A Social Thinking Curriculum for School-Age Students</a> by Michelle Garcia Winner. Meanwhile, many activities were designed by myself, and the resources were from the internet, linked in the corresponding slides.

The lesson includes three activities: (1) Watch a video about school bus behaviors and discuss the problems and solutions; (2) Watch a video about bullying and respect and practice the words "Stop! Don't touch my body."; (3) Dance to a song. When one student says "stop," everyone has to stop dancing. The lesson can be downloaded <a href="social/Social Class C.pptx">here</a>.

      The fourth lesson includes three activities: (1) Watch a video and discuss "think" and "brain"; (2) Use a guessing game to demonstrate how messages come from our ears to our brains and how we use our brains to think; (3) Demonstrate how we use our brains to remember and recall things. Let the students close their eyes and recall their favorite food. Let the students color the brain on a coloring sheet, draw a thinking cloud, and draw or write their favorite food.

      The fifth lesson includes five activities: (1) Demonstrate that it is harder to answer certain questions with eyes closed because our eyes help us get messages and think; (2) Guess what people are thinking based on what their eyes are looking at; (3) Demonstrate how eye contacts can show who we are talking to by asking individual students questions; (4) Demonstrate how eye contact can show people your needs by passing around a bouquet to a student who is making eye contact; (5) Do an eye yoga.

      The seventh lesson was an incorporation lesson before the winter vacation. The lesson includes three games to incorporate the social communication skills learned throughout the semester: (1) Turn-taking game: use your eyes to show that you want to take a turn; (2) Who's the Leader: The group pays attention to others and imitate each other, and the individual guesser use their eyes to think; (3) Santa Says: Only follow the directions when Santa wears a hat, use our brains to think, and use our eyes to think. The lesson can be downloaded <a href="social/Social Class G.pptx">here</a>.
